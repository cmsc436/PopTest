# MS-BalloonTest
CMSC436 Multiple Sclerosis Project - Balloon Activity Test

Part of the Multiple Sclerosis Testing Suite. Use must pop bubbles as they appear in random locations on the screen. This app tests user reaction time by averaging the time taken to respond to new bubbles appearing. There are three different difficulty settings that are also taken into account for final user score.

This app is integrated with a front end app that sends averaged results to a centralized google spreadsheet. The PopTest app also records more detailed data in a separate spreadsheet. 

This project was created as a part of the CMSC436 Handheld Deivces curriculum at the University of Maryland, College Park.
